# 🧑‍💻 Introduction

As web applications become increasingly complex, it's becoming more and more important to keep the main thread of the browser free from computationally intensive tasks. This is where Web Workers come in. Web Workers provide a way to run JavaScript code in the background, on a separate thread from the main UI thread. This can help improve performance and make your application more responsive.

# 💻 Body

Web Workers are a powerful tool for improving the performance of your web applications. They work by allowing you to run JavaScript code in a separate thread from the main UI thread. This can help keep your UI responsive, even when you're doing computationally intensive tasks.

One of the key features of Web Workers is that they can communicate with the main thread using a messaging system. This allows you to pass data back and forth between the two threads, making it easy to update the UI with new data or to send user input to the background thread.

Another powerful feature of Web Workers is that they can be used to create shared workers. Shared workers allow multiple tabs or windows to share the same background thread. This can be a great way to improve performance and reduce the amount of memory used by your application.

# 🤔 Conclusion

In conclusion, Web Workers are a powerful tool for improving the performance of your web applications. By allowing you to run JavaScript code in the background, on a separate thread from the main UI thread, you can keep your UI responsive and improve the overall performance of your application.
