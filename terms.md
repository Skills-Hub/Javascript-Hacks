### Javascript Terms 

1. **Variables**: Storage areas in a house, like cabinets or drawers, where you keep items for later use.
 
2. **Data Types**: The kind of items you store: string (labels on drawers), numbers (quantities of items), or booleans (light switches: on/off).

3. **Objects**: A section of your house with various attributes: kitchen (with properties like 'sink', 'oven', and 'fridge').

4. **Arrays**: A series of similar storage units, like shoe racks, holding multiple items in an ordered manner.

5. **Functions**: Set routines in the house: a bedtime routine (`sleep()`) might involve shutting doors, turning off lights, and going to bed.

6. **Callbacks**: Setting your coffee machine (a function) to run after your alarm goes off (another function).

7. **Events**: Things that happen in the house triggering reactions, like the doorbell ringing leading to you checking the door.

8. **Event Listeners**: The attention you pay to certain events. If you're waiting for a package, you "listen" for the doorbell.

18. **Inheritance**: A renovated room that inherits features from its original design.

19. **Promises**: Assurances of future work. Like hiring a contractor, it might be pending, fulfilled (work done), or rejected (work can't be completed).

20. **Async/Await**: Planning tasks in sequence. Await the completion of the kitchen renovation (`await`) before beginning the living room.

21. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Instructions for visitors. For example, "Ring the bell for entry" is an API for your house.

54. **State**: The current status of every room — lights on or off, windows open or closed, etc.

55. **Higher-Order Functions**: Hiring an interior decorator (a function) who then uses other professionals (other functions) like carpenters or electricians to do the job.

56. **Pure Functions**: A standard cleaning routine that always cleans the same way and produces the same cleanliness level, regardless of the room's initial state.

57. **Side Effects**: After renovating a room, you notice that the adjacent room now needs repainting — an unintended consequence of the main task.

58. **Local & Global Scope**: Local items are those confined to a specific room, while global items, like the house's main door key, can be used everywhere.

59. **Memoization**: Keeping a diary of tasks. If a specific task, like fixing a light, has been done recently, you skip doing it again.

60. **First-Class Functions**: Treating tasks as if they're objects. You can assign a task (like "cleaning") to different members, store them in a list, or even combine them.

61. **Truthy & Falsy Values**: Quick checks on house chores. If a chore is marked (truthy), it's done; if not marked (falsy), it's pending.

62. **Pass by Value & Pass by Reference**: Giving someone a copy of your house key (pass by value) vs. lending the original key (pass by reference).

64. **Timeout & Interval**: Setting tasks with specific timing. A `timeout` is like waiting 10 minutes before watering plants. An `interval` is watering them every 10 minutes.

65. **Callback Queue & Event Loop**: Organizing house chores. Tasks (callbacks) are queued up and the house owner (event loop) picks them up one by one, ensuring the house runs smoothly.

66. **NaN (Not a Number)**: Imagine ordering 5 chairs and receiving a table. That’s unexpected, so the order is `NaN`.

67. **Falsy Values**: Areas in the house where you're likely to misplace items. Places like "under the sofa" or "behind the fridge" are typically where lost items (undefined or null values) might be.

68. **Truthy Values**: Reliable storage spots where items are always found, like a designated key bowl.

69. **Strict Mode**: House rules to ensure everyone acts correctly, preventing potential pitfalls.

70. **Primitives & Objects**: Basic building blocks (primitives) like bricks and cement vs. constructed entities (objects) like rooms and doors.

71. **Synchronous & Asynchronous**: Doing chores sequentially (synchronous) vs. multitasking, like washing dishes while laundry runs (asynchronous).

74. **Middleware**: The middle processes of a task, like filtering tap water before drinking.

75. **Callback Hell**: Having so many interconnected tasks (like chores dependent on other chores) that it becomes overwhelming to keep track.

76. **Module**: Designing your house in sections. The kitchen module includes everything about kitchens - from sinks to ovens.

77. **Import/Export**: Moving furniture between rooms or houses. `Export` is making a piece of furniture available to move, and `import` is bringing it into a new room or house.

78. **Ternary Operator**: A quick decision tool. If it’s raining (condition), take an umbrella (true case); otherwise, wear sunglasses (false case).

79. **Falsy Coercion**: Mistakenly considering an empty wardrobe as a space to fit more clothes, even if it's reserved.

80. **Wrapper Objects**: Protective covers for delicate items. For example, a fragile vase (primitive) gets a protective box (wrapper object) when moved.

81. **Base Classes & Derived Classes**: Basic house designs (base) that can be customized with additional features (derived).

82. **Getters & Setters**: Controlled access to rooms. ‘Getters’ allow you to view a room, and ‘setters’ let you modify it.

83. **Lexical Environment**: The current status and setup of a specific room, including its decor and contents.

84. **Expression vs. Statement**: Seeing a pre-built house and buying it (expression) versus planning to build a house (statement).

85. **Truthy Coercion**: Treating the lounge's faint light as sufficient, even if it's not ideal for reading.

86. **Dynamic Import**: Deciding to add an extension to your house on-the-fly, based on some new needs.

87. **Type Conversion & Type Coercion**: Manual room repurposing (conversion) vs. temporarily using a study as a bedroom when guests arrive (coercion).

88. **Mutability & Immutability**: Adjustable furniture layout (mutable) versus fixed installations like a fireplace (immutable).

89. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**: A task, like cleaning, that's started and completed immediately after planning.

90. **Garbage Collection**: Automatic disposal of unused items to free up space.
