# 🌐 Introduction
In modern web development, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a powerful technique for creating fast and responsive web applications. AJAX enables web pages to make asynchronous requests to a server, which means that the page can update content without having to reload the entire page. ASP (Active Server Pages) is a server-side scripting language that can be used with AJAX to create dynamic web applications. In this blog, we'll explore how to use JavaScript AJAX with ASP to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

# 💻 Body
To use AJAX with ASP, we need to create an ASP page that will handle the request made by the JavaScript code. Here's an example of an ASP page that returns the current time:

```asp
<%
    Response.ContentType = "text/plain"
    Response.Write(Now)
%>
```

In the above code, we set the content type to "text/plain" and write the current time to the response. We can now use JavaScript AJAX to make a request to this ASP page and display the response on our web page.

Here's an example of how to make an AJAX request using jQuery:

```javascript
$.ajax({
    url: "time.asp",
    success: function(result) {
        $("#time").html(result);
    }
});
```

In the above code, we make a request to the "time.asp" page and set the result to the content of the element with the ID "time". When the request is successful, the "success" function is called and the result is displayed on the page.

# 🏁 Conclusion
Using JavaScript AJAX with ASP is a powerful way to create dynamic and responsive web applications. With AJAX, we can update content on a web page without having to reload the entire page, making our web applications faster and more user-friendly.
